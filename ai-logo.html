            <h2>My first experience leveraging AI to do design work.</h2>
            <p>
                At Dubberly Design I was working with a client called DrumWave, a brazilian data company. Their logo was a seven set venn diagram, with each set assigned a color, and each section was the average color of the overlapping sets. 
            </p>
            <img src="images/drumwave_logo.svg">
            <p>
                This results in 128 colors in the logo.

            </p>
            <p>
                Originally the seven colors were mathematically calculated to evenly split the color wheel, but this resulted in them being not quite optically balanced.
            </p>

            <p>
                So I was tasked with redrawing the logo with a  new set of optically balanced seven colors. To calculate the resulting averages by hand would have taken hours, and would need to be done for every iteration.
            </p>
            <p>
                I knew this could be automated, so I turned to the then new chatGPT to figure out how. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At first I had it create a python program to take in a set of seven hexcodes, and return the 128 average hex codes.

            </p>

            <p>
                Then I had it return an svg of the 128 color palettes, so one could use the eyedropper tool to recolor the logo.
            </p>
            <img src="images/color_palette.svg">
            <p>
                Finally I had it create a program that takes as an input 7 colors, calculates the 128 colors, and recolors a given svg file provided to it. This way I had fully automated the process of creating logo variations.

            <p>
                This was the first time I had used an LLM for something useful in the design process, and was a revelation for me and for the other designers at Dubberly Design.

                        What appears to be a simple change is made laborious by the many inner sets that must be recolored:                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After the several iterations of the program, creating new versions of the logo became trivial:                </div>

                <div class = "column">
                    <p>
                        I was tasked with calculating the inner colors and making a list of their hexcodes. I was supposed to do it manually, but that would take hours, and I knew that it could be done programmatically, however I didnâ€™t know how to code it, so I turned to ChatGPT.

                <div class = "column">
                    <p>
                        The process was very iterative. I would ask GPT to write a program, run it, see if it worked, and refine my prompts. The process was like a conversation, a cycle of prompts from me and responses from the model.                    </p>

                    <h3>First I made sure it understood the problem:</h3>
                    <small>I am making a picture of a seven set venn diagram.
                        Every section overlaps every other section in all possible combinations,
                        resulting in 128 individual sections. 
                        If each of the seven sets is a specific color (hex value), 
                        and every section is the average color of the sets that overlap in it, 
                        how can I calculate the colors for all 128 sections?
