            <h2>My first experience leveraging AI to do design work.</h2>
            
            <p>
                This is a poster I worked on while working at Dubberly Design Office. It is a collection of ways of representing Venn diagrams of many sets. The idea arose from a discussion of solution sets, including collections of clock faces, and design systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Venn diagrams are often used to represent solution spaces, so the poster was meant to display a solution space of solution spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Venn diagrams beyond three sets can no longer be fully represented with only circles, as overlaps will start to be left out.            </p>

            <p>
                Sets of four and five can be represented fully with ovals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Greater number of sets are no longer trivial, and rely on complicated shapes to work out.
                Many mathematicians and hobbyists have contributed to creating higher set venn diagrams,
                Such as this canonical one:
                            </p>
            <p>
                The ‘hot dog’ method:

            </p>
            <p>
                Venn diagrams can also be quite elegantly displayed as sine waves. Sine waves can be used to draw a venn diagram of any number of sets.
            </p>

                This was the first time I had used an LLM for something useful in the design process, and was a revelation for me and for the other designers at Dubberly Design.
