            <p>Hi! I am a passionate designer by day, and artist and animator by night. </p>

            <div class="project-text">
            <p>On the lookout for my next role, I am excited to leverage my visual design and systems thinking skills to build something great. I am extremely observant, a fast learner, with a knack for figuring out complex problems.</p>

            <p>Professionally, I have created digestible diagrams for complex systems, created user personas, and researched and written and presented on the frameworks of LLMs, Image generators, and HVAC systems. Recently I have been fascinated with iOS development, and just finished creating myQuilt, an AI powered journaling app.</p>
            
            
            <p>On the side I love creating art. Drawing and painting are my go to, but I mix in some screen printing and animating to keep things fresh.</p>

            <p>Keep scrolling to see examples of my work.</p>

                            Create a gamified journaling app, which uses OpenAI’s APIs to generate a color and image that represent the mood of the journal entries. The created colors and images provide a ‘reward’ for journaling, intended to make journaling a more fun habit. The user can flip through the journal as pages, or view a thumbnail quilt of a visual representation of their mood over time.

I made the app for fun, because I wanted to learn iOS development, become familiar with using APIs, especially those having to do with AI. I also wanted to start journaling, and had the idea to create a journaling app that provides some feedback for entries.

                            The goal of this project was to redesign a logo for a data company called DrumWave. I created a program to automate this surprisingly complicated process, and in the process discovered how useful the at the time new ChatGPT was as a tool for design.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Motivation:</em><br>
The logo is a seven set Venn diagram, where the outer sets originally  were 7  colors evenly spaced around the color wheel. However, the colors were not optically balanced, there were two greens that were very close to each other. Recoloring the logo was not trivial, as the other 121 overlaps are the average color of the overlapping sets, meaning any shift in the outer colors requires all inner sections to be recolored. I created a program to replace all the colors in an svg of the logo based on any seven colors.

                        <p>I designed and implemented a journaling app, which leverages the OpenAI API for text and image generation. The app uses the power of AI to create a visual record of the user's mood by crating a color and pattern representation of the users' input. The result is a quilt: a grid of blocks, each with a pattern and color based off of the journal entries of the user. At a glance the user is provided with a visual memory of their emotions, and has the option to select any square to reread their own entry.</p>
