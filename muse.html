                <p><em>Goal</em><br>
                    The goal was to create a device that lets users generate music from their current emotional state, either to keep the good vibes rolling or gently guide themselves toward a nicer mood. We used a set of emotional sliders, an LLM interpretive layer, and Google's Lyria API to translate those inputs into music. We chose sliders because we wanted a way to communicate with AI without text as a new, more tactile ways of communicating with AI, and to explore it as a material for design.

                    Our first version was a simple plywood rig to hold our sliders while we built and tweaked the software. It was crude but a proof of concept.

                    Our faceplate went through several iterations. from multiple plates for each section, to different grill designs, we eventually landed on this version. Brushed steel with counter sunk screens and engraved labels.

                <p>Our final version featured a sleek stainless steel face plate, ergonomic sliders, a 3D printed frame, and audio and visual feedback.</p>
                <p>Complex emotions, compressed into seven dimensions, and woven into generated music, all inside a minimal and beautiful wall mounted interface. A subtle accessory to any home, introducing emergent technology in an ambient and friendly way.</p>
