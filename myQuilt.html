            <h2>How it works:</h2>
            <img src="images/MyQuiltMap.svg" alt="myQuilt's initial diagram">
            <p>
                At first, the concept was to have three tabs, navigatble by a tab bar at the bottom: a journal view, with swipable pages,
                a grid view, that would later become the quilt, and a text entry view.
            </p>
            
                    <p>The App opens to the quilt view screen, where the user can view their past entries as a grid, or quilt of colors and images. To generate a new entry, the user taps the plus icon at the bottom to bring up the text entry view, and enters their thoughts. The text is passed to the GPT-4 API, which generates a json file with four parts: a hexcode for the chosen color, a name for the color, an explanation for why the color was chosen, and a prompt for an image generator for a quilt square based on the entry. </p>
               <br>
                    <p>The first three items are added to the new entry, and the prompt is sent to the Dall-e 2 API, which generates an image, and adds that to the entry.
                        Then the new entry is added to the entries array ( a list of all the entries thus far) which is used to render the quilt and journal views.</p>

                <li>This led me to the an important insight: I could get rid of the bottom task bar altogether, and use the tapping of the quilt squares to navigate to the journal view, at the page corresponding to the tapped square. The user can still swipe though like a book, but the overall interface is simplified and more intuitive.

            I dropped the skeumorphic design in favor of a simple UI that emphasized the entries' colors. Also I updated the quilt view to be more pleasant and include the date and time of the entry.

The final version of the app does away with the tab bar navigation. The grid cells in the quilt are now tapable, allowing the user to access the journal view, which keeps its swipable functionality. Additionally, AI image generation is now included to further sell the quilt theme. A prompt is generated from the entry, and is piped over to Dalle to generate the image.
